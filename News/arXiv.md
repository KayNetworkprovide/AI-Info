[About Litmaps](https://www.litmaps.co/about)

Collaborators: **Kyle Webster, Axton Pitt, Digl Dixon, Hamish Huggard, Racheal Reeves**, Litmaps

[Litmaps](https://www.litmaps.co/) is an innovative research discovery tool. It combines interactive citation maps, modern search tools, and targeted updates to create a cohesive research discovery experience. It can visualize your research topic with everything from articles, patents, books, pre-prints, and e-prints. From arXiv abstract pages, you can build a literature map from the arXiv article you are viewing, visualizing the top connected articles, and browse the citation network around it.

## Hugging Face Spaces

![a decorative icon of the Hugging Face labs project](https://info.arxiv.org/labs/images/huggingface-logo.png)

[About Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/huggingface)

Collaborators: **Abubakar Abid**, **Omar Sanseviero**, **Ahsen Khaliq**, and the **[Hugging Face team](https://huggingface.co/huggingface)**

Hugging Face Spaces includes links to demos created by the community or the authors themselves. By going to the Demos tab of your favorite paper in the arXiv categories of computer science, statistics, or electrical engineering and systems science, you can find links to open-source demos and try them out immediately. With Spaces, Hugging Face users can share, explore, discuss models, and build interactive applications that enable anyone with a browser to try them out without having to run any code. These demos are built using open-source tools such as the Gradio and Streamlit Python libraries, and leverage models and datasets available on the Hugging Face Hub.

## IArxiv

[About IArxiv](https://iarxiv.org/about), [Sign up for IArxiv](https://iarxiv.org/home)

Collaborators: **Ezequiel Alvarez**, ICAS, Professor at UNSAM, **Cesar Miquel**, Easytech, and the **[Easytech team](https://iarxiv.org/about)**

IArxiv allows readers to receive, by email, daily arXiv papers in a growing number of categories sorted by artificial intelligence according to their preferences. IArxiv learns each reader’s preferences first by fetching previous papers authored by the reader. Then, those preferences are updated over time based on the papers opened by that reader within the emails or on iarxiv.org. IArxiv runs an unsupervised Machine Learning algorithm, called LDA, to extract which topics are present in each paper, and in which proportions, to construct a vector of topics for each reader.

[About Scite Smart](https://scite.ai/)

Collaborators: **Josh Nicholson**, **Domenic Rosati**.

Scite is a platform for discovering and evaluating scientific articles via Smart Citations. Smart Citations allow users to see how a publication has been cited by providing the context of the citation and a classification describing whether it provides supporting or contrasting evidence for the cited claim. With the Scite Smart Labs project, viewers can see this information directly on the abstracts page.

[About Replicate](https://replicate.com/about), [Replicate arXiv docs](https://replicate.com/docs/arxiv)

Collaborators: **Ben Firshman** and **the Replicate team**

Machine learning is still extremely hard to use. Research is typically published as a PDF, with scraps of code on GitHub and weights on Google Drive. The Replicate Labs project makes it easy to share and associate your machine learning model with your arXiv paper in a way that is easy for other people to use.
